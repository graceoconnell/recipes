12 shallots
1/2 cup half-n-half
unsalted butter
2 eggs
salt/pepper/nutmeg

for 10 minutes, simmer shallots with a bit of water. Warm the cream. Add eggs, seasoning, warm cream and shallot to blender and blend until smooth.

With a fine sieve/cheesecloth, pass the mixture through.

Butter the inside of the ramakins, and add the mixture into each.

In a oven pre-heated at 275, add the ramakins to a roasting pan and fill the empty space with boiling water until half-way up the ramakin's sides.

Let sit for 5 minutes (top optionally with roasted shallots)
