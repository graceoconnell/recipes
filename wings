Butter (3 oz.)
Wings (24)
Hot Sauce (1/4 cup
Garlic (3 cloves)
Salt


NOTE: keep wings from touching each other. Steam wings for 10 minutes, then place pat-dried wings in fridge for an hour. On a rack over parchment paper, cook wings in a preheated oven at 425 degrees for 20 minutes. Turn each over and let cook for another 20. Minced garlic, unsalted butter, salt, and hot sauce should be tossed with the wings.
