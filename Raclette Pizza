topping:

raclette cheese
spinach or arugala
proccutto

sauce:

blanch yellow tomatos, slightly, peel skin, cut and remove seeds. slightly crush the tomatos and salt to taste.


dough:

1 cup white unbleached flour
1 cup mesa
1 cup high gluton flour
1 cup warm lager
2 tablespoons instant yeast
2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt

Pour some of the warm beer into a bowl. The beer should be about 85 to 115Â° F. Add the honey and salt. Mix by and hand (or any other method) until well blended. Add the yeast and mix some more. Let this mixture sit for about 5 minutes. Add 1 cup of flour and the olive oil and mix until well blended. Add the rest of the flours and beer and mix well. The dough should turn into a ball. 

Once the dough is balled up, place the ball on a floured board and knead for a couple of minutes. Place the dough in a slightly oiled bowl and store in a warm, dry area to rise.

After about 45 minutes the dough should have about doubled in size. Punch it down until it deflates. Let it rise for another hour to an hour and a half. The dough is now ready to be rolled out. Sprinkle the surface of flat cookie sheet with corn meal, top dough with cheese, tomato, greens, and put in oven until done (12 minutes). Rotate every few mintes to get the whole pizza consistantly cooked. Top with proccutto, and drizzle olive oil lightly. 

oven:

Heat a slab of rock or tablette in the oven for an hour at 500 degrees. Turn off heat and use tablette to put the dough directly atop.
