Saute some garlic, onion, jalapenos or chipotle and add chorizo until cooked. Drain and set aside.
Make a Roux, 2 tbsp (equal parts flour and butter combined in hot pot)
Once it's thick and light brown, add a big can of condensed milk and have another can ready if it gets too thick
lower the heat. More. Lower. Seriously. do you want that shit to get all oily and separate? Prolly not.
You impatient bastard. just take it off the heat.
Add grated cheddar, jack and asadero until melted. maybe a little cream cheese too. There's probably some in the back of the fridge next to the yogurt I always forget to take to work.
Add the peppers and chorizo and stir it up!
