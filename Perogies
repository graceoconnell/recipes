(Makes about 16 large perogies)

Dough Recipe:
-2 1/2 cup all purpose flour
-1 cup sour cream
-1 egg
-1 egg yolk
-1 tbsp olive oil
-1 tbsp melted (but cooled) butter
-s&p to taste
-anything extra to make it special (i use a squirt or two of cock)

Keep wet ingredients whisked together in a bowl and room temp until ready to start making the dough (mixing with flour).

Filling Recipe:
-3 baking potatoes (baked for 1 to 1 14 hours) --> Stab with fork to let steam out and light coating with olive oil.
-1 head garlic for roasting with baked potatoes... Only use about half in filling
-1 tbsp cock sauce
-1 tbsp yellow mustard
-2 tbsp grated onion
-2 tbps grated green pepper
-1 cup grated cheese (mix of fontina, sharpe white cheddar, orange cheddar is good)

Steps:
Start with baking the potatoe and roasting garlic at 350 F. Garlic head needs the top chopped and filled up with olive oil. Don't bother salting that garlic, it is perfect just as it is. Garlic takes about 40 min to turn golden brown (take out and set aside). At this point turn the potatoes over .. Note that a tray to keep the garlic on is desired on the lower level of oven, while potatoes bake on upper rack above the tray to keep drippings on tray.

At about an hour (potatoes almost baked), start making the dough.. Mix wet ingredients with flour and kneed well. This is a fairly wet dough, not like pizza dough at all. Should be closer to play dough consistency more than anything. Cut dough in half and set aside to wait for filling to be done.


Empty potato into bowl with other filler ingredients (without skin) and mash into mashed potats. Cheese should melt well. Don't cheap out on the cheese, you want soemthing that will melt well and also give strong flavor.


Roll out the dough thin enough so that it doesn't tare but is about 3/4 centemeter thick and place small balls of filler onto the center of the dough. Fold dough over in half so that bottom and top cover the filler. Get a glass and 'cut' out each ball of perogie from the dough. This dough is easy to reuse so extra dough discarded from the cutout can be used easily.

FREEZE! Don't bother eating for a while... no no sir. After these freeze, you can either drop em in boiling water (they done when they float) or fry em in butter. I prefer the latter.

Serve with lots of sour cream. Another goodie is frying with onions and add on the side of sour kraut.
