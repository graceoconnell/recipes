For bread I chose whole grain flax seed bread although i'm sure this would
be good on something else too.

-mayo, mutard, and cock sauce
-fresh dill, ethiopian (berbere) sprinkled and perhaps a pinch of salt n pep
-thick coating of smoked sockeye pate
-thin sliced onion and tomatoe
-mesquite smoked chicken breast slices
-blue brie cheese (same amount as the pate)

Grill that thing like a grilled cheese on pan.
