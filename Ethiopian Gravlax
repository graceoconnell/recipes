2-3 lbs salmon fillet (center cut)
1-part salt
1-part sugar
Berbere to taste (roughly half amount of salt)
Dill (bunch)

Combine the spice, and coat the fish as heavily as possible. Surround fish with dill, and refrigerate wrapped up in plastic wrap, or place in an air-tight tupperware. Allow to rest for 24 - 72 hours. Remove fish and scrape off as much as the brine as possible. Pat dry.

Optional: Garnish with fresh dill. A fine compliment is cold avocado puree or gaspachio.
