- 1 large whole large chicken, butchered into 6 parts
- 1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 1 cup of red or green olives, pitted and rinsed
- 1/2 cup of raisins
- 1 tbsp of parsley, chopped
- 1 tbsp of cilantro, chopped
- 1 preserved lemon, rinsed well and peel thinly sliced (discard pulp)
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 3 pinches of saffron
- 1/4 tsp of turmeric
- 1 tsp of ground ginger
- 2 1/2 cups of water
- 2 tbsps of melted butter
- olive oil
- kosher or sea salt and ground pepper

In a mixing bowl, combine the garlic, saffron, ground ginger, turmeric, a pinch of salt and ground pepper, and a couple glugs of olive oil.  Pour the mixture over the chicken and reserve any leftover marinade.

In a tagine or a large heavy pot heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil over medium high heat and add the onions in.  Cook for a few minutes until they have softened and are turning translucent.  Pour the rest of the marinade over the onions and nestle the chicken on top of the onions skin side up.  Cover the chicken with the 2 1/2 cups of water.  Cover with a lid and let it simmer on low heat for about 45-50 minutes.

Preheat your oven to 400 degrees with the rack on the highest position.  Remove the chicken when it’s done simmering and place it on a baking sheet, skin side up.  Brush the skin with the melted butter and bake until the skin gets golden, about 10 minutes.

Continue simmering the sauce and add the parsley, cilantro, raisins, olives and preserved lemon.  Let the mixture simmer and reduce for about 15 minutes over low heat.  Taste the sauce and add salt and pepper to taste.  Don’t forget the preserved lemon and olives will add a significant amount of salt so salt after you’ve added the rest of the ingredients.

Place the chicken back in the sauce and serve with couscous and more olives and preserved lemons.
