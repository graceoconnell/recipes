10 ea shallots, peeled
Duck fat, butter, or olive oil to cover
aromatics, if desired

Place shallots, fat and aromatics in a heavy pan (cast iron works well).  Cover the top with a round of parchment paper that has a small hole cut out in the middle (this helps keep the shallots submerged.)  Cook over low heat, essentially sweating out the shallots.  Cook until tender, about 45 minutes.  Cool, remove from fat, drain, and store refrigerated until use, up to a week.
