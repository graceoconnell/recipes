2-3 catfish fillets
2 teaspoons maple syrup or molasses
1 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons A1 sauce
2 tablespoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons of honey
2 tablespoons Olive Oil
1/2 cup guiness beer
3 garlic cloves, roasted, chopped
1 shallots, minced
1-2 hot chiles, such as thai or serrano
small bunch of cilantro
 

Mix the fish sauce with the other liquids and coat the fish in it. Let this stand for 30 minutes.
In a pot just large enough to contain the fish, heat the oil over medium heat and saute the garlic, chile and shallot for 1-2 minutes. Do not let them brown.
Add the catfish and all the marinade. Mix well, turn the heat down to medium-low, cover and simmer for 10 minutes.
Pour in enough water to almost cover the catfish, then turn the heat until boiling then reduce to medium. 
Cook this uncovered until the sauce reduces by half, about 15 minutes. Be sure to turn over the fish a couple times so both sides get coated by the sauce.
Turn out the fish into a bowl, garnish with cilantro  and serve with wild rice.
