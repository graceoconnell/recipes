1 rabbit skinned, gutted and jointed
1 bouquet garni
2 cloves garlic, lightly crushed
1 pt chicken stock
1 pt water
100g cubed pancetta
1 stalk of rosemary, leaves removed
2 banana shallots, finely sliced
Handful of button mushrooms
1 carrot, peeled and sliced
1 courgette, sliced
2 tbsp sherry vinegar
250ml white wine
1 large tbsp tomato puree
1 can chopped tomatoes
1 handful cherry tomatoes, halved
Tagliatelle – enough for 4 people
Sea salt and freshly ground pepper
Olive oil


For the rabbit: bring the water and stock to a simmer in a large pan, add the garlic cloves and bouquet garni. Season the jointed rabbit and rub olive oil all over it, place in the pan and leave on a very low simmer for approx 1-2 hours or until tender. Remove rabbit from the cooking liquor and leave to cool slightly, when it has cooled, remove the meat from the bones, shredding the larger pieces where necessary.

For the sauce: in a heavy based pan brown the pancetta add the rosemary leaves, add the shallots, carrots and mushrooms and sauté for 3-4 minutes until everything has a good colour, add the courgettes and cook over a medium heat until the veg has started to caramelise, this should take approx 5 mins, deglaze the pan with the sherry vinegar, when this has evaporated to a syrup add the wine and reduce till there is about a quarter of the volume left.

Make a well in the center of the pan and tip in the tomato puree, make sure to give this a good fry as this will help the puree to taste cooked, after about a minute stir into the vegetables, add the cherry tomatoes and tinned tomatoes and spoon a couple of lades of the liquid the rabbit was cooked in to the pot. Leave on a low simmer for 30 mins. Add the rabbit to the sauce along with a tbsp of grain mustard, gentry fold together and taste. Season accordingly and serve with the tagliatelle.
