2-3 pounds foreleg of pig, pre-cut and cleaned
5 cups water
1 thumb-sized piece ginger, sliced
2 strips nishimi kubu (see note)
6 medium dried shiitake mushrooms
5 medium daikon (turnip), peeled and cut into large chunks
1/4 cup soy sauce or miso
1 teaspoon Hawaiian salt
2 tablespoons sake
1 small bunch mustard cabbage, parboiled and cut in 2-inch lengths (may substitute watercress or winter melon)

The day before, cover pig's feet in water and bring to a rolling boil; drain and rinse. Return pig's feet to pot and cover with the 5 cups water. Boil for 10 minutes at high heat. Reduce heat to medium for 15 minutes, then add ginger. Cook 30 minutes more until meat is tender. Refrigerate pig's feet and stock separately overnight.

The next day, remove fat from refrigerated stock. Wash kubu; tie knots about 3 inches apart. Cut into sections. Soak shiitake in warm water with a pinch of sugar, 20 to 30 minutes. Reserve liquid; cut mushrooms into quarters, discarding stems.

Combine reserved mushroom water with enough stock to make 7 cups. Add pig's feet, kubu, mushrooms and daikon; cook 10 minutes. Add soy or miso, salt and sake; cover and simmer 1 hour, gently stirring 2 or 3 times.

Just before serving, add mustard cabbage. Grated ginger may be served as a condiment. Serves 6 to 8.

Note: Nishimi kubu is Okinawan-style konbu, or dried kelp, prepared specially for nishimi (in Japanese, nishime; in English, vegetables stewed with a small amount of meat). It is thinner than regular konbu. Some cooks soak their konbu up to an hour before cooking; in that case do not add it to the soup until the last few minutes. Nishimi kubu is available at Japanese or Asian markets. If you can't find it, substitute regular konbu.
