lemons
salt 
olive oil
water

Submerge the lemons in water for 2 days.
Quarter the lemons lenght-wise not going all the way through. Salt the interiors liberally.
In a a large sealable containter, put the lemons in and press them down so they are all snug and won't float.
Prime with a bit of water, and add olive oil last so it can create a seal. Store in a dark cool location and after 3-4 weeks they are ready.
