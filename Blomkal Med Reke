2 1/2 cups cold water
1 lb fresh medium shrimp, in the shells
1 large cauliflower
2 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons flour
1/2 cup half-and-half
1/4 teaspoon salt, to taste
1/4 teaspoon white pepper, to taste
1 link dried sausage

Peel and de-vein the shrimp, reserving the shells, and coarsely chop the shrimp meat into 1/2-inch sized pieces; then set the meat aside.  Place the reserved shrimp shells only (not the uncooked shrimp meat) in a stockpot together with the water; turn temperature to high and bring to a boil, then reduce to low, cover, and let simmer for 20 minutes. While stock is simmering, break the cauliflower into small florets and steam until tender, about 15 minutes. Strain shells from the stock and reserve the liquid. Add flour to butter in a saucepan over medium heat and cook until golden. Gradually stir in the shrimp stock, sausage and half and half and whisk together until thick. Add salt and white pepper and stir well, then add the uncooked chopped shrimp and cook for about 5 minutes or until shrimp turns pink, careful not to overcook or the shrimp will toughen.
