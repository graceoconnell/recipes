*  10 cups chicken stock (about..)  OR left over turkey meat is daaamn good.
*  1 whole chicken cut up in parts (remove skin n bone from meet)
*  11 chiles guajillo (i found mine dried in a package n then just seeded and stemmed em then soaked in water for about 20 min)
*  9 red chiles ancho (same..  these def need to soak for a while if you find em dried)
*  5 black pepper corns (toasted then ground in mortar pestle)
*  6-8 whole cloves (toasted then ground in mortar pestle)
*  4 or 5 whole allspice (toasted then ground in mortar pestle)
*  1 2inch piece of cinnamon (toasted then ground in mortar pestle)

* 1-2 tsp oregano leaves (dried)

* 5 cloves garlic (crushed)
* 1 large shallot (sliced/chopped coarsely)
* 1 white onion (quartered)
* 5 med tomatoes (quartered)
* 1 plantain (roasted in tin foil in the oven at 350F for about 30min)
* Handfull of almonds (about 10-15)
* twice as many raisins as there are almonds
* Couple cubes of bakers chocolate (really just by taste for this.. i use the 70% cocoa i think)
* 1 Tbsp tahini
* 1/2 French roll (sliced then fried until brown on surface)
* Salt n Sugar to taste.


Directions:

-Put the plantain in tin foil and bake in over for about 30 min.. then set aside
-Soak the chiles for about 20min.  Strain most of the water then puree them and push through a sieve and set aside (discard extra seeds n skin... should make about a half cup of chile paste/sauce.. pretty runny is normal).  If the chiles are fresh then you will need to toast them at low heat then set them in hot water for about 20 min.  I found that my final product was pretty tame for spice level so keeping in some of the seeds will help if you are looking for something more spicy.

- Toast the pepper corns, allspice, cloves and cinnamon together then grind em down to a powder in a mortar pestle and set aside for onion/garlic/shallot mix.
- Cook garlic, onion and shallot in pan (no oil or butter) until translucent.  (I added some chicken stock about half way through to the mix to keep it from burning but def boil off all the stock)
- puree the onion mix with the toasted n ground spices and some stock (about 1/2 cup stock) then set aside.
- At medium heat cook tomatoes with the oregano (no oil or butter) until thoroughly cooked through (paste like).. (again i added some chicken stock to keep from burning and let it reduce down).
- puree the tomato mix and push through a sieve.
- melt 2 tbs butter/lard/olive oil and fry the bread slices on both sides and set aside.  Use the same oil and fry up the raisins until plump (about 2 min).  Set raisins aside.  Fry the almonds (whole) until they turn slightly brown (about 2 min).  Set aside almonds.
- In food processor, blend the plantain, fried bread slices, raisins and almonds with 2-3 cups of stock.


- In a large stockpot heat up 2tbs of butter and heat until smoking (high heat).  Turn down heat to low and add the chile paste and stir until it is fairly thick.  Add the tomato sauce and reduce again.  Add the onion mix and pureed plantain mix and tahini and mix well and turn up heat to medium.  Add 5 cups chicken stock and let it heat up for about 30 min (stir frequently).  Add the chocolate and any chicken/turkey (apparently rabbit works well too) and let the chocolate dissolve (stir frequently).  Add sugar to taste.

The sauce is ready when a spoon is coated.
