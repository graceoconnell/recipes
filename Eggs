Slow Poached Eggs

In a deep pot of water at exactly 140 degrees F., add eggs and kook for 45 minuts in a pot lined with items to keep the eggs off the bottom (forks, what-have-you). Serve within 24 hours by cracking them into the desired dish. Let the dish itself heat the eggs through.

Soft Boiled Eggs

3 quarts (12 cups)  water
1-6 large eggs

Bring water to a simmer in a medium pot. Reduce heat until water is barely quivering. Gently lower eggs into water with slotted spoon or strainer (do not drop eggs into water, or they might crack). Cook for exactly 6 minutes, then remove eggs with slotted spoon, and serve.

Hard Boiled Eggs

Note: If you have a particularly strong burner, a very thin-walled pot, or live at high altitudes or in a very cold or hot environment, initial volume of water may need to be adjusted. Once you figure out the specific volume for your location, use that same volume every time.

1.5 quarts (6 cups) cool water
1-6 large eggs

Place eggs and water in saucepot. Place over high heat and bring to a bare simmer. Immediately shut off burner and wait at least ten minutes. Peel eggs under cool running water, and serve.
