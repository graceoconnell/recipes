400 grams fresh tagliatelle or fettucine
300 grams minced beef – The recommended cut is thin flank aka skirt (finta cartella in Italian) but any good quality mince will do.
150 grams unsmoked pancetta — minced very finely
50 grams carrot — finely chopped or minced
50 grams celery — finely chopped or minced
50 grams onion — finely chopped or minced
30 grams triple concentrated tomato puree(if using double concentrated, increase the quantity by about a 1/3)
1/2 glass dry vermouth
180 milliliters fresh milk
olive oil
salt and pepper

Fry the pancetta gently in a little olive oil until it starts to release its fat. Be careful not to burn.
Add the vegetables and fry until the onions are transparent, stirring from time to time.
Add the beef and cook until it is lightly browned. When it starts to make popping noises, it’s done.
Add the tomato puree and the wine and mix well.
Add the milk, little by little until it is completely absorbed.
Season with salt and pepper, cover and cook very slowly for 3 to 4 hours.
Stir occasionally and if it looks like drying out, add a little more milk.
Serve with Fettuccine or Tagliatelle (NOT Spaghetti!)
Serve with Parmesan cheese on the side. Alternatively toss the pasta first in a little butter and then in Parmesan before adding the meat sauce.
Variation: The Academy allows the addition of Porcini mushrooms.
